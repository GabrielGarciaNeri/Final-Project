    <h2 class="mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there! 👋 I'm the creator of <strong>Learn a Language</strong> — a quirky, AI-powered language learning tool made to educate and entertain. 🎉</p>

    <p>I built this site to help people explore new vocabulary, improve their language skills, and maybe even chuckle while doing it. Whether you're brushing up on French, testing your Spanish slang, or trying to understand why your quiz sounds so sarcastic... that's intentional. 😉</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding or yelling at my terminal, I'm probably learning new languages myself, exploring tech, or thinking about which snack to eat next.</p>

    <p>This app is still growing, so if you have suggestions, feature ideas, or just want to say “hi” — check out the <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">Contact</a> page!</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by. Let's keep learning, one sarcastic AI quiz at a time. 💡</p>
